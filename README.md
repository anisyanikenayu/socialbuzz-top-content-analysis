## Executive Summary

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Content Growth
From June 2020 to June 2021, the total amount of content produced from images, audio, videos, and GIFs remained stable each month, although there was a noticeable drop in June. January and May saw higher content production, likely due to significant events such as the New Year celebrations in January and the Idul Fitri holiday for Muslims in May. Given that Islam is the world's largest religion, these occasions prompted users to share various moments and interactions online. In contrast, total reactions experienced a decline in February, possibly because many people were preoccupied with their activities during that time. Meanwhile, from July to December, content levels appeared stable, as several countries were enjoying their summer holidays.
