Over past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They faced rapid growth which it produces 10K content posts per day and in order to adjust their business to global scale, they need to utilize their data to support their effort.

## Executive Summary
Social Buzz, a social media platform founded in 2008, has experienced rapid growth, reaching over 500 million active monthly users and generating 10,000 content posts daily. To maximize profitability and scale globally, data insights reveal that content production remains stable except for a drop in June, with spikes in January and May due to significant events like New Year and Eid Al-Fitr. Users strongly prefer animal-related content, followed by science, technology, and food, with travel or culture which still inside the scope reflecting their interests in enjoyable and informative themes. To capitalize on these insights, I recommend launching seasonal campaigns such as a "Healthy Food Challenge" or other thing during celebrations or special day, making partnerships with online travel agencies, healthy food/groceries, or tech brand for sponsored content, and engaging influencers to amplify reach. By leveraging these strategies, Social Buzz can enhance user engagement and drive profitability effectively.

## Insights Deep-Dive
### Content Growth
From June 2020 to June 2021, the total amount of content produced from images, audio, videos, and GIFs remained stable each month, although there was a noticeable drop in June. January and May saw higher content production, likely due to significant events such as the New Year celebrations in January and the Eid Al-Fitr holiday for Muslims in May. Given that Islam is the world's largest religion, these occasions prompted users to share various moments and interactions online. In contrast, total reactions experienced a decline in February, possibly because many people were preoccupied with their activities during that time. Meanwhile, from July to December, content levels appeared stable, as several countries were enjoying their summer holidays.
### Popular Content
Based on the data, content with a total score and positive reaction trace value exceeding 60,000 and a large total reaction size shows that users strongly prefer animal-related content with score 74k. This is followed by topics such as science, technology, and food, which are still in the top 5 content categories. Users appear to favor content that is "life-enjoying," "informative about technology and science," and "entertaining." This preference is also reflected in content related to travel and culture, which remain within this scope.

In the era of 2021, particularly among social media users such as Generation Z and Millennials, there is a growing awareness of self-love and a desire to become healthy, informative/knowledgeable, happy, and open-minded individuals.

In contrast, topics with lower scores are predominantly dominated by sports-related content. This could be due to the perception that such activities only relate to a specific minority of users.

## Recommendations
- **Seasonal Campaign**
  - Healthy Food Challenge: Collaborate with health food brands and influencers to create a "Healthy Food Challenge" during significant celebrations like New Year or Eid Al-Fitr. This can encourage users to share their healthy recipes or meal preparations, generating user-generated content (UGC) that enhances engagement.
  - Cultural Celebrations: Develop campaigns around cultural events or holidays, encouraging users to share their experiences related to travel and culture. For example, a "Cultural Exchange Challenge" or "A Day in A Vacation" could invite users to showcase traditional dishes or customs from different regions.
- **Partnerships with Brands and Influencers**
  - Collaborate with Online Travel Agencies: Form partnerships with travel agencies to create content that highlights travel destinations, tips, and cultural experiences. This could include sponsored posts, travel vlogs, or contests where users can win travel-related prizes.
  - Influencer Marketing: Work with content creators who align with the themes of animal content, science, technology, and food. Influencers can help amplify campaigns by sharing their experiences and encouraging their followers to participate in challenges.
- **Sponsored Content**: Create sponsored posts featuring brands that align with Social Buzz top content categories. For instance, collaborate with a tech company for informative posts about new gadgets or apps.
## Assumptions and Caveats
- **Vagueness Trends**: The content and reaction numbers consistently drop in June, both in 2020 and 2021. Interestingly, these months are positioned at the end of the data timeline. This raises a question: is the data for June fully complete, covering the entire month? To gain a clearer understanding, it may be beneficial to gather additional data to determine whether user activity consistently reaches its lowest point every June. This analysis would provide a more reasonable answer and inform actionable strategies to enhance engagement during this period.
